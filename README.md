# MetroNexus – Delhi Metro Route & Fare Calculator

A **Java-based console application** that computes the shortest route and fare between two Delhi Metro stations using graph algorithms and heap data structures. It also displays an interactive metro map for enhanced user navigation.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Simulates the Delhi Metro network using a weighted graph with 100+ nodes and edges.
- Computes shortest path and fare using **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.
- Each station node stores relevant data like **station name**, **corridor**, and **inter-line connectivity**.
- Includes an interactive metro map for better route planning and visualization.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java  
- **Algorithms:** Dijkstra, BFS, DFS  
- **Data Structures:** Graphs, Heaps, OOP Concepts

## 🧠 Requirements

- Any IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans, or online editors like ideone.com).  
- Basic knowledge of **Java programming** is recommended.  
- Familiarity with **graphs**, **heaps**, and **graph traversal algorithms** (Dijkstra, BFS, DFS) is helpful.  
- Understanding of the **Java Collections Framework** is a plus.
